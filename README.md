Hey!

I don't know what goes in a GH readme so until I write a real one, have a little shpiel.

I still have a lot of work to do and features to add, but now that comments, vig shot, and emergency meeting are added I feel confident releasing something that will at least make GMs lives a little easier and make players a little more independent.

I am positive there are things that could be done better. It's been ages since I earnestly attemped to do something like this. I took CS classes in college more than a decade ago and then realized that programming outside of little hobby things is soul crushingly boring and haven't really done it in any personal capacity in the 10-ish years since. I tried to intern/shadow/work/whatever at multiple places and found out that they all just specialized in weirdly narrow things like "We make the shopping carts for online stores" and the idea of 40 hour weeks of coding that over and over made me wanna fucking die.

If there are things to be improved, please let me know. I'd love to keep learning about how to properly do this! Doing something that I know people will use and that makes me feel like I'm contributing to something even as small as a weird little internet game has me more amped for this than I've been for a personal project in quite a while.

The code is also super poorly commented. I'll work on it. In the meantime, if there's anything you have questions about or would like explained let me know. I'd love to talk about it beyond just complaining in the test server about stuff no one else can see lol

Thanks for looking!
